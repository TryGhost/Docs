* `@page.show_title_and_feature_image` - true (default) or false value from Ghost Editor

This toggle, only available for pages, lets users hide a page’s title and feature image to create pages that look radically different than posts (for example, full-width headers, CTAs, and landing pages).

This setting is only available when using the [new Beta editor](https://ghost.org/changelog/editor-beta/). However, since the `@page.show_title_and_feature_image` is always present and defaults to `true`, supporting this feature in your theme won’t break anything for anyone using the old editor.

Using the `@page` object is **not backward-compatible** with earlier versions of Ghost: once implemented the theme will only be compatible with Ghost 5.54.1 or later.

## Example code

```handlebars
{{#match @page.show_title_and_feature_image}}
...content...
{{/match}}
```

## Styling tips when hiding the title and feature image

1. Whenever the page title and feature image are hidden, and the page content starts with a full-width card (such cards will have the class `.kg-width-full`), remove spacing between the top navigation and content (on pages only).
2. Whenever multiple full-width cards are stacked, remove spacing between them (on posts and pages).
3. Whenever content ends with a full-width card, remove spacing between the content and the footer (on pages only, posts often have additional content at the bottom such as comments, CTAs, related posts, etc.).

As a reminder, cards that have the ability to be set to full width are header cards, signup cards, image cards, and video cards. When an image or video has a caption, it will have the class `.kg-card-hascaption`, and maintaining spacing is desirable in this case.

The implementation of these changes will look different on every theme.
