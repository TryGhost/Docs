## llms.txt

The [llms.txt](https://docs.ghost.org/llms.txt) file is an industry standard that helps general-purpose LLMs index more efficiently, similar to how a sitemap helps search engines.

AI tools can use this file to understand the Ghost documentation structure and find relevant content to your prompts.

## llms-full.txt

The [llms-full.txt](https://docs.ghost.org/llms-full.txt) file combines all of the Ghost docs into a single file as context for AI tools.
