title: "Image Upload Issues"
description: Image uploads can be affected by the default max upload size of 50mb. If you need more, youâ€™ll need to increase the limit by editing your nginx config file, and setting the limit manually.

## Troubleshooting

* Log into your server
* Navigate to your Ghost installation folder with `cd /var/www/ghost`.
* Type: `nano system/files/your-domain.conf` to open your NGINX config file.
* Edit `client_max_body_size {VALUE}M;`
* Finally, press `ctrl` + `x` to exit. Nano will ask you if you want to save, type y for yes, and press enter to save the file.
* Restart NGINX by running `sudo service nginx restart`.
