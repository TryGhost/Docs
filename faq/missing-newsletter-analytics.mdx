title: "Missing Newsletter Analytics"
description: Open rates that are 0% may indicate that the connection between Ghost and Mailgun has stalled, which prevents Ghost from fetching your newsletter analytics.

***

To recover your newsletter analytics, [restart Ghost](/ghost-cli/) by running `ghost restart` from the command line. Restart Ghost as soon as possible because Mailgun logs are only kept for a limited time, after which the logs are no longer recoverable. It’s also best practice to restart Ghost when no newsletters are scheduled to be sent. (If you’re on Ghost(Pro), contact [support@ghost.org](mailto:support@ghost.org) for support).

We’re currently working on improving the connection between Ghost and Mailgun so that this issue doesn’t occur in the future.
