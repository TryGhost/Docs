title: "Cannot find module 'sqlite3'"
description: Ghost local missing sqlite module due to Python & setuptools being needed for build
---

***

### Error

If you see etiher of these errors when using Ghost-CLI:

```
Python is required for SQLite3
```

or

```
Python setuptools is required for SQLite3 when using Python 3.12+
```

Then either python3 or setuptools are missing from your machine. Follow the instructions above to get them installed.


### To fix

Starting with Node.js v22, there are no longer pre-built binaries to download for the sqlite3 module. To successfully build a binary for Node 22 you'll need to have python 3 and setuptools installed.

Ensure these tools are available by following the instructions below for your machine:

 - MacOS users with Brew: `brew install python-setuptools` - will install python3 + setuptools
 - MacOS users with Python installed locally: `python3 -m pip install setuptools` - will install setuptools
 - Ubuntu users: `apt install python3-setuptools` - will install python3 + setuptools
 - Windows users: `winget install Python.Python.3` - will install python3, then `pip install setuptools` will install setuptools


### Cannot find module 'sqlite3'


You may also see error messages like:

```
Message: Ghost was able to start, but errored during boot with: Knex: run
$ npm install sqlite3 --save
Cannot find module 'sqlite3'
```

If you're trying to use Ghost with sqlite3 without using Ghost-CLI. The same fixes above apply.
