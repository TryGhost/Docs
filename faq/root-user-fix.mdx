## Error

`We discovered that you are using the DigitalOcean One-Click install. You need to create a user with regular account privileges and migrate your installation to this user.`

## Solution

When you installed Ghost with the [DigitalOcean One-Click install](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/one-click-apps/ghost/) you probably set up your Ghost installation as a `root` user. As of Ghost-CLI 1.5.0, running Ghost commands as `root` is disallowed. Therefore you will need to migrate your current installation to a new Linux user.

Run the following steps as `root` user to fix it:

Add a new user:

```bash
adduser <user>
```

Add user to sudo group:

```bash
usermod -aG sudo <user>
```

Now create a new instance file and move to new user location:

```bash
mkdir -p /home/<user>/.ghost/

chown <user>:<user> /home/<user>/.ghost

mv /root/.ghost/config /home/<user>/.ghost/config

chown <user>:<user> /home/<user>/.ghost/config
```

Next, change into your ghost installation directory (`/var/www/ghost/` is default in the DigitOcean One-Click installs) to change the ownership of your installation files:

```bash
cd /var/www/ghost
```

And then execute this command (might take a while):

```bash
find . -group root -user root -exec chown <user>:<user> {} \;
```

Last step, Login as new user:

```bash
su - <user>
```

You can check `ghost ls` now to see if your installation is still up and running.
