## Stability Index

* **Stable** - forward compatible changes only
* **Experimental** - being actively worked on, may receive breaking changes
* **Deprecated** - scheduled for removal

## Accept-Version Header

`Accept-Version: v{major}.{minor}`

The ‘Accept-Version’ header allows clients to indicate the minimum version of Ghost they can operate with. It also allows Ghost to determine and communicate if any recent breaking changes are unsuitable for a given client.

When the `Accept-Version` header is received, Ghost will respond with a `Content-Version` header indicating the version of the Ghost install that is responding.

If the `Accept-Version` header is received and the request cannot be processed, Ghost sends an email to the site’s owner and administrators with the details of the problem, to make it easy to find and fix issues with outdated clients.

Ghost [major versions](/faq/major-versions-lts/) ship every 8-12 months, meaning code you write against our API today will be stable for a minimum of 2 years.
