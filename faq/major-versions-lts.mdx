At any one time the current major version of Ghost is under active development, whilst the previous version is maintained as the Long Term Support version (LTS).

The **current** version of Ghost receives new features and improvements on a regular basis. The **LTS** version of Ghost will only receive critical security and stability fixes.

Once a version reaches End of Life it should be considered insecure.

The [update guide](/update/) describes the steps for updating from Ghost 1.0 or higher, to the **latest version** of Ghost.

If you’re running an 0.x version of Ghost, you’ll need to follow the [update guide](/faq/update-0x/) first to update to 1.0, as there is no direct update path from versions \< 1.0 to the latest version.
