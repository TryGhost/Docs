title: "How To Resolve Errors When Running Ghost Start"
description: If an error occurs when trying to run `ghost start` or `ghost restart`, try using `ghost run` first to check that Ghost can start successfully. The `start` and `restart` commands are talking to your process manager (e.g. systemd) which can hide underlying errors from Ghost.

***

Find your Ghost log files in `/content/logs/` to identify if the problem exists with Ghost itself, or the process manager.
