Our team [release](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/releases) updates to the open source software every week, and you can find out whether new updates are available any time by running `ghost check-update`.

If you’re already running the latest major version (`6.x`) - update using Ghost CLI by running

```bash
ghost update
```

That's it\! If you want to be super safe, run `ghost backup` first.

## Updating to the latest major version (6.x)

If you're running Ghost 5.x with MySQL 8, updating your Ghost-CLI site is still just as easy as usual, but there are [breaking changes](/changes) you should check out first.

<Note>
The web analytics feature is not compatible with Ghost-CLI. There is a docker-based hosting method currently in preview, which includes a migration tool for Ghost CLI sites: [check it out](/install/docker).
</Note>

If you're on an older version, or not using MySQL 8, getting up-to-date is slightly more involved. Below is a full breakdown of the the recommended update paths for older Ghost versions.

[**Updates are recommended for sites that are:**](/update-major-version/)

- Running Ghost version `3.0.0` or higher and are using MySQL in production
- Development sites using any database

[**A full reinstall of Ghost is recommended for sites that are:**](/reinstall/)

- Running on a Ghost version less than `3.0.0`
- Using SQLite3 in production on any Ghost version

| Ghost Version | Database | Update method                    |
| ------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| \< 2.x        | Any      | [Reinstall](/reinstall/)         |
| 3.x, 4.x      | SQLite   | [Reinstall](/reinstall/)         |
| 3.x, 4.x      | MySQL    | [Update](/update-major-version/) |
| 5.x           | MySQL    | [Update](/update-major-version/) |

[_If you’re using MariaDB it is recommended to migrate to MySQL 8 - read more about supported databases._](/faq/supported-databases/)
