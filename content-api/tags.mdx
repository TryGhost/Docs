title: Tags
description: Tags are the [primary taxonomy](/publishing/#tags) within a Ghost site.

```js
GET /content/tags/
GET /content/tags/{id}/
GET /content/tags/slug/{slug}/
```

By default, internal tags are always included, use `filter=visibility:public` to limit the response directly or use the [tags helper](/themes/helpers/tags/) to handle filtering and outputting the response.

Tags that are not associated with a post are not returned. You can supply `include=count.posts` to retrieve the number of posts associated with a tag.
