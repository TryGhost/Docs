## Exporting your subscribers

To get started, [download your full subscriber list](https://support.beehiiv.com/hc/en-us/articles/12234988536215-How-to-export-subscribers) (**Export Subscribers (Full)**) from BeeHiiv.

## Import subscribers to Ghost

If all of your subscribers are free, you can import this into Ghost directly.

If you have paid subscribers, you need to relate Stripe Customer IDs with your subscribers emails.

If you cannot connect your Ghost site to the same Stripe account you used with BeeHiiv, you may need to migrate customer data, products, prices, coupons to a new Stripe account, and then recreate the subscriptions before importing into your Ghost site. The [Ghost Concierge](https://ghost.org/concierge/) team can help with this.

## Migrating Content

Developers can migrate content from BeeHiiv to Ghost using our [migration CLI tools](https://github.com/TryGhost/migrate/tree/main/packages/mg-beehiiv).

You will first need to [export your posts](https://support.beehiiv.com/hc/en-us/articles/12258595483543-How-to-export-your-post-content) from BeeHiiv. This will be a CSV file which includes all post content, titles, dates, etc.

First, make sure the CLI is installed.

```sh
# Install CLI
npm install --global @tryghost/migrate

# Verify it's installed
migrate
```

To run a basic migration with the default commands:

```sh
# Basic migration
migrate beehiiv --posts /path/to/posts.csv --url https://example.com
```

There are [more options](https://github.com/TryGhost/migrate/tree/main/packages/mg-beehiiv#usage), such as the ability define a default author name and choose where `/subscribe` links go to.

Once the CLI task has finished, it creates a new ZIP file which you can [import into Ghost](https://ghost.org/help/imports/).

### Using custom domains

If youâ€™re using a custom domain on BeeHiiv, youâ€™ll need to implement redirects in Ghost to prevent broken links.

BeeHiiv uses `/p/` as part of the public post URL, where as Ghost uses it in the URL for post previews. This means the redirect regular expression is quite complex, but necessary so that post previews in Ghost function correctly.

```yaml
# redirects.yaml
301:
  ^\/p\/(?![0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12})(.*): /$1
  ^\/polls\/[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}(.*): /
  ^\/t\/(.*): /tag/$1

302:
```

This means that if a visitor or crawler goes to `https://mysite.com/p/awesome-post`, they will automatically be redirected to `https://mysite.com/awesome-post`.
