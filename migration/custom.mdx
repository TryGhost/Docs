description: "If no export tools exist for your current plublishing platform you’ll need to create one that generates a JSON file as described here. There is a full example at the end of this file. Please note that your final JSON file should have no comments in the final format. Those are only included here for readability and explanatory purposes."

### JSON file structure

First and foremost, your JSON file must contain valid JSON. You can test your file is valid using the [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) online tool.

The file structure can optionally be wrapped in:

```json
{
  "db": [...contents here...]
}
```

Both with and without are valid Ghost JSON files. But you must include a `meta` and a `data` object.

### The meta object

```json
"meta": {
    "exported_on": 1753891082041,
    "version": "6.0.0"
}
```

The `meta` block expects two keys, `exported_on` and `version`. `exported_on` should be an epoch timestamp in milliseconds, version should be the Ghost version the import is valid for.

### The data block

Ghost’s JSON format mirrors the underlying database structure, rather than the API, as it allows you to override fields that the API would ignore.

```json
"data": {
  "posts": [{...}, ...],
  "posts_meta": [{...}, ...],
  "tags": [],
  "posts_tags": [],
  "users": [],
  "posts_authors": []
}
```

The data block contains all of the individual post, tag, and user resources that you want to import into your site, as well as the relationships between all of these resources. Each item that you include should be an array of objects.

Relationships can be defined between posts and tags, posts and users (authors).

IDs inside the file are relative to the file only, so if you have a `post` with `id: "1234"` and a `posts_tags` object which references `post_id: "1234"`, then those two things will be linked, but they do not relate to the `post` with `id: "1234"` in your database.

The example below is a working but simplified to cover most use-cases. To see what fields are available,  types, lengths, and validations, please refer to the [Ghost schema on GitHub](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/main/ghost/core/core/server/data/schema/schema.js).

## Example

```json
{
    "meta": {
        "exported_on": 1753891082041,
        "version":     "6.0.0" // Ghost version the import is valid for
    },
    "data": {
        "posts": [
            {
                "id":             "1234", // The post ID, which is refered to in other places in this file
                "title":          "My Blog Post Title",
                "slug":           "my-blog-post-title",
                "html":           "<p>Hello world, this is an article</p>", // You could use `lexical` instead to to represent your content
                "comment_id":     "1234-old-cms-post-id", // The ID from the old CMS, which can be output in the theme
