Tiers allow publishers to create multiple options for an audience to become paid subscribers. Each tier can have its own price points, benefits, and content access levels. Ghost connects tiers directly to the publication’s Stripe account.

### The tier object

Whenever you fetch, create, or edit a tier, the API responds with an array of one or more tier objects.

By default, the API doesn’t return monthly/yearly prices or benefits. To include them in the response, use the `include` parameter with any or all of the following values: `monthly_price`, `yearly_price`, `benefits`.

```json
// GET admin/tiers/?include=monthly_price,yearly_price,benefits
{
    "tiers": [
        {

Available **include** values:

* `monthly_price` - include monthly price data
* `yearly_price` - include yearly price data
* `benefits` - include benefits data

Available **filter** values:

* `type:free|paid` - for filtering paid or free tiers

For browse requests, it’s also possible to use `limit`, `page`, and `order` parameters as documented in the [Content API](/content-api/#parameters).

By default, tiers are ordered by ascending monthly price amounts.
