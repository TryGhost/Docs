Webhooks allow you to build or set up [custom integrations](https://ghost.org/integrations/custom-integrations/#api-webhook-integrations), which subscribe to certain events in Ghost. When one of such events is triggered, Ghost sends a HTTP POST payload to the webhookâ€™s configured URL. For instance, when a new post is published Ghost can send a notification to configured endpoint to trigger a search index re-build, slack notification, or whole site deploy. For more information about webhooks read [this webhooks reference](/webhooks/).

```js
POST /admin/webhooks/
PUT /admin/webhooks/{id}/
DELETE /admin/webhooks/{id}/
```

### The webhook object

Webhooks can be created, updated, and removed. There is no API to retrieve webhook resources independently.
