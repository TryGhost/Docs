Pages are [static resources](/publishing/) that are not included in channels or collections on the Ghost front-end. They are identical to posts in terms of request and response structure when working with the APIs.

```js
GET /admin/pages/
GET /admin/pages/{id}/
GET /admin/pages/slug/{slug}/
POST /admin/pages/
POST /admin/pages/{id}/copy
PUT /admin/pages/{id}/
DELETE /admin/pages/{id}/
```
