title: "How To Install Ghost With Docker (preview)"
description: Preview our new batteries-included tools for self-hosting Ghost using Docker compose.
---

## Overview

With the launch of Ghost 6.0 we are also previewing a new suite of tooling for self-hosters built on Docker with compose.
We invite you to be one of the first to try hosting Ghost with this new tooling, which comes with full support for self-hosting
both the Social Web (ActivityPub) and Web Analytics (Tinybird) features.

#### Why Docker?

So that we can continue adding advanced features to Ghost without creating bloat, we're starting to build some features as separate services.
Using Docker and Docker compose takes all the pain out of managing different services and their dependencies, meaning we can keep Ghost's architecture simple
without passing on complexity to our self-hosting community. All services are Open Source and can be self-hosted.

## New Installs

### Pre-requisites
- A Linux-based server with Docker installed (we recommend )
- A domain name with a DNS **A-Record** pointing to the server’s IP address
- An email service for transactional mail [More info](/config/#mail)
- (Optional) A [tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/) account for web analytics


### Ghost Install

This section will get you a fresh setup of a working Ghost instance.

### Enabling Web Analytics

This section assumes you’ve completed a fresh setup from the section above or have migrated an existing site to Docker.

### Enabling Social Web (ActivityPub)

By default, all new Ghost installs are configured to use the Ghost(Pro) hosted ActivityPub Service, meaning the Social Web features work out of the box.
This hosted service is free to use for all self-hosters, with some [usage limits]()

If you would like to host the ActivityPub Service yourself, follow these steps:

#### Hosted ActivityPub Usage Limits
Self-hosters are free to use our hosted ActivityPub service, up to the following limits:

* 2000 max. followers
* 2000 max. following
* max. 100 interactions per day (interactions include: create a post/note, reply, like, repost)

If your usage exceeds this, you'll need to switch to self-hosting ActivityPub.
