title: "How To Install Ghost With Docker (preview)"
description: Preview our new batteries-included tools for self-hosting Ghost using Docker compose.
---

With the launch of Ghost 6.0 we are also previewing a new suite of tooling for self-hosters built on Docker with compose.
We invite you to be one of the first to try hosting Ghost with this new tooling, which comes with full support for self-hosting
both the Social Web (ActivityPub) and Analytics (Tinybird) features.

#### Why docker?

Our latest and greatest features are full-fat implementations, that made sense to build as completely separate services to Ghost
itself. Using Docker and Docker compose takes all the pain out of orchestrating these different services and their dependencies.
