title: "Using Cloudflare With Ghost"
description: "If you’ve added Cloudflare to your self-hosted Ghost publication and find that Ghost Admin doesn’t load after updates you may run into some errors in the JavaScript console:"

***

### Error

Open developer tools to check for errors in the JavaScript code:

`TypeError: n.item is not a function or Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string`

### To fix

It is recommended that you add a page rule which turns off some RocketLoader, mirage2 and autominify for the path `/ghost*`, so these features don’t affect the Ghost admin panel.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/c4549abf-cloudflare-ghost_hu3292e1ab34393a3f83860fc03720b502_39786_791x0_resize_q100_h2_box_3.webp" />
</Frame>

This solution is for developers who are maintaining a self-hosted instance of Ghost. If you’re on Ghost(Pro) both nginx and Cloudflare are configured as standard and you don’t need to do anything.
