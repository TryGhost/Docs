description: If the sqlite3 database file is not readable or writable by the user running Ghost, then you’ll run into some errors.

### Error

Unable to open sqlite3 database file for read/write (exit code 236)

### To fix

By default, this file exists in `content/data/` but this path may also be configured in your config file.

**Ensure that the path in the config is correct and that the path is both readable and writable by the user running Ghost.**

This solution is for developers using the supported Ghost install method using ghost-cli. If you’re having problems with an unsupported custom install, check out the community forum.

### Upgrading to Ghost 1.0?

When migrating to Ghost 1.0, you’ll need to use a JSON export file to import your site content. There is no way to migrate to 1.0.0 using only an SQLite3 DB file.

For general backups, keep a copy of your sqlite database file by stopping Ghost before copying the file to prevent corruption.
