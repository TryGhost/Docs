title: "Missing SSL Protocol"
description: After installing Ghost a url for your site is set. This is the URL people will use to access your publication.

***

### Error

If you see an error of `ERROR: URL in config must be provided with protocol` this means the URL has been set with HTTPS but the SSL protocol is missing.

### To fix

Use ghost setup ssl in the ghost-cli to setup an SSL certificate for your publication.
