The recommended approach to achieve scale, performance & high availability is to put a cache and/or CDN in front of your blog; pages generated by Ghost are essentially static so there should be very little traffic hitting your Ghost server with a well configured cache.

### Error

If you try to run Ghost on multiple nodes, you will run into errors such as Response code `405 (Method Not Allowed)` - and find that the Ghost service needs to be constantly restarted for any content to reliably appear.

### To fix

The correct solution is to reduce your infrastructure to a single node and use caching.
