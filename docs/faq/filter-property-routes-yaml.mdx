### Specify inverse filters

In the current beta version of Dynamic Routing it’s necessary to specify the inverse of filters using - to ensure pagination is correct. For example:

```yaml
collections:
  /es/:
    permalink: /es/{slug}/
    filter: tag:es
  /fr/:
    permalink: /fr/{slug}/
    filter: tag:fr
  /:
    permalink: /{slug}/
    filter: tag:-[fr,es]
```

### Order filters

In a collection, the post lives in the first collection where it matches the filter, so it’s important to consider the order of your filters and place more generic filters towards the end.

If you are seeing unexpected behaviour and posts living inside the wrong collection, then you may need to revise the order of your filters.
