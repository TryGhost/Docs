Themes can be uploaded from a local ZIP archive and activated.

```js
POST /admin/themes/upload;
PUT /admin/themes/{ name }/activate;
```

### The theme object

When a theme is uploaded or activated, the response is a `themes` array containing one theme object with metadata about the theme, as well as its status (active or not).

`name`: *String* The name of the theme. This is the value that is used to activate the theme.

`package`: *Object* The contents of the `package.json` file is exposed in the API as it contains useful theme metadata.

`active`: *Boolean* The status of the theme showing if the theme is currently used or not.

`templates`: *Array* The list of templates defined by the theme.

```json
// POST /admin/images/upload/
{
    themes: [{
      name: "Alto-master",
      package: {...},
      active: false,
      templates: [{
        filename: "custom-full-feature-image",
        name: "Full Feature Image",
        for: ["page", "post"],
        slug: null
      }, ...]
    }]
}
```
