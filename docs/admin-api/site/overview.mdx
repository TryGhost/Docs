title: Site

Site is a special unauthenticated, read-only endpoint for retrieving basic information about a site. This information is useful for integrations and clients that need to show some details of a site before providing authentication.

```js
GET /admin/site/
```

### The site object

The site endpoint returns a single object, rather than an array.

`title`: *String* The title of the site, same as the title returned from the `settings` endpoint.

`description`: *String* The description of the site, same as the description returned from the `settings` endpoint.

`logo`: *String* The logo of the site, provided as a relative path. Same as the logo returned from the `settings` endpoint.

`url`: *URI* The frontend URL for the site, which can be different to the Ghost Admin / API URL. This comes from the configuration JSON file.

`version`: *Semver String (major.minor)* The current version of the Ghost site. Use this to check the minimum version is high enough for compatibility with integrations.
