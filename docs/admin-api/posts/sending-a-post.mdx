title: Sending a Post via email
---

To send a post by email, the `newsletter` query parameter must be passed when publishing or scheduling the post, containing the newsletter’s `slug`.

Optionally, a filter can be provided to send the email to a subset of members subscribed to the newsletter by passing the `email_segment` query parameter containing a valid NQL filter for members. Commonly used values are `status:free` (all free members), `status:-free` (all paid members) and `all`. If `email_segment` is not specified, the default is `all` (no additional filtering applied).

Posts are sent by email if and only if an active newsletter is provided.
<RequestExample>
```json
// PUT admin/posts/5b7ada404f87d200b5b1f9c8/?newsletter=weekly-newsletter&email_segment=status%3Afree
{
    "posts": [
        {
            "updated_at": "2022-06-05T20:52:37.000Z",
            "status": "published"
        }
    ]
}
```
</RequestExample>
When a post has been sent by email, the post object will contain the related `newsletter` and `email` objects. If the related email object has a `status` of `failed`, sending can be retried by reverting the post’s status to `draft` and then republishing the post.
