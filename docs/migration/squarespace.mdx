You can easily migrate your posts from your Squarespace site to Ghost in just a few clicks, using the built-in Squarespace migrator in Ghost Admin.

## **Run the migration**

The Squarespace migrator allows you to quickly import content from your Squarespace site to your Ghost publication. You can access the migrator tool from the **Settings → Advanced →** **Import/Export** area of Ghost Admin.

It's helpful to log in to your Squarespace site before running the migration in Ghost Admin.

### **1. Enter your Squarespace URL**

To start the migration process, enter the public URL to your Squarespace site, and click **Continue**.

### **2. Export content**

Next, click **Open Squarespace settings.** If already logged into Squarespace, this will take you directly to the location of your Squarespace site where an export can be generated.

Click **Export**, which will download an XML file with your content in it.

### **3. Upload content**

Once your export has been downloaded, return to the migrator window in Ghost Admin, and select **Click or drag file here to upload**, and navigate to the XML file you downloaded from Squarespace, once uploaded click **Continue**.

If you're unsure of where the file was saved, check your Downloads folder.

### **4. Review**

Ghost will confirm the number of posts and pages that will be imported to your publication. If satisfied, click **Import content** to begin the import of your data.

### **Redirects**

<Info>
  Squarespace categories are converted to [tags](https://ghost.org/help/tags/) during the migration. The first category for any post will also become the [primary tag](https://ghost.org/help/tags/#primary-tags).

You may need to add [redirects](https://ghost.org/help/redirects/) to ensure backlinks lead to the correct content.

Please refer to this list of the [most common redirection rules for Squarespace migrations](https://ghost.org/tutorials/implementing-redirects/#squarespace).
