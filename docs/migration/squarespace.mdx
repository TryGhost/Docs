If you're a Ghost(Pro) customer, our team may be able to help you migrate your content and subscribers. Learn more about our [Concierge service](https://ghost.org/concierge/).

Migrations from Squarespace are a complex manual process with a lot of data sanitisation work. If you want to do a migration yourself, youâ€™ll need to follow our [developer documentation](/docs/migration/custom/) to create your own migration archive.
