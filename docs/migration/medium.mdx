## Self-service Migration

Most publishers can do this right now using our [Medium migrator](https://ghost.org/help/importing-from-medium/).

### Using custom domains

If youâ€™re using a custom domain on Medium, youâ€™ll need to implement redirects in Ghost to prevent broken links.

Medium appends a small random ID to each post, which is removed in the migration step above. The regular expression below removes that random ID, but does not affect preview links.

```yaml
# redirects.yaml
301:
    ^\/(?!p\/?)(.*)(-[0-9a-f]{10,12}): /$1

302:
```

This means that if a visitor or crawler goes to `https://mysite.com/awesome-post-a1b2c3d4e5f6`, they will automatically be redirected to `https://mysite.com/awesome-post`.
