You can easily migrate your posts and subscribers from Medium to Ghost in just a few clicks, using the Medium migrator in Ghost Admin.

## **Run the migration**

The Medium migrator allows you to quickly import content and members from your Medium to your Ghost publication. You can access the migrator tool from the **Settings → Advanced →** **Import/Export** area of Ghost Admin.

It's helpful to log in to your Medium account before running the migration in Ghost Admin.

### **1. Enter your Medium URL**

To start the migration process, enter the public URL to your Medium, and click **Continue**.

### **3. Upload content**

Once your export has been downloaded, return to the migrator window in Ghost Admin, and select **Click or drag file here to upload**, and navigate to the zip file you downloaded from Medium, once uploaded click **Continue**.

If you're unsure of where the file was saved, check your Downloads folder.

### **4. Export subscribers**

Next, it's time to import your Medium subscribers. Click **Open Medium Audience stats**, and click **Export this list**.

Once downloaded, select **Click or drag file here to upload** and navigate to the text download, and click **Continue**.

### **5. Review**

Ghost will confirm the number of posts and members that will be imported to your publication. If satisfied, click **Import content and subscribers** to begin the import of your data.

After a few moments, you'll see a confirmation message, confirming that your data was successfully migrated to your Ghost site.

### **6. Verification and manual checks**

<Warning>
  ⚠️ The Medium content export includes all of your posts and **all of the comments you've written across Medium**. There is no sure-fire way to differentiate between these content types, so you should check the import to verify your posts are live.
</Warning>

The importer will make a post in Ghost for all posts and comments in your Medium export. The importer will try to sort posts and comments, based on the following rules:

- If a piece has only one paragraph, treat it as a **comment**
- If a piece of any length has an image, treat it as a **post**
- Otherwise, treat the piece as a **post**
- All pieces that are treated as **comments** will be saved as **drafts**
- All **posts** that were **drafts** in Medium, will be **drafts** in Ghost
- All **posts **that were **published** in Medium will be **published** in Ghost

You should check that comments and posts were sorted correctly. Possible comments that have been saved as drafts will be tagged `#Medium Possible Comment`.

### Using custom domains

If you’re using a custom domain on Medium, you’ll need to implement redirects in Ghost to prevent broken links.

Medium appends a small random ID to each post, which is removed in the migration step above. The regular expression below removes that random ID, but does not affect preview links.

```yaml
# redirects.yaml
301:
    ^\/(?!p\/?)(.*)(-[0-9a-f]{10,12}): /$1

302:
```

This means that if a visitor or crawler goes to `https://mysite.com/awesome-post-a1b2c3d4e5f6`, they will automatically be redirected to `https://mysite.com/awesome-post`.
