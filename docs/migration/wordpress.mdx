You can easily migrate your posts and pages from WordPress site to Ghost in just a few clicks, using the WordPress migrator in Ghost Admin.

## **Run the migration**

The WordPress migrator allows you to quickly import content from your WordPress site to your Ghost publication. You can access the migrator tool from the **Settings → Advanced →** **Import/Export** area of Ghost Admin.

### **Redirects**

<Info>
  ℹ️ WordPress categories are converted to [tags](https://ghost.org/help/tags/) during the migration. The first category for any post will also become the [primary tag](https://ghost.org/help/tags/#primary-tags).

You may need to add redirects to ensure backlinks lead to the correct content.
