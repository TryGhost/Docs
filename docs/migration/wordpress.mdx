## Self-service Migration

Most publishers can do this right now using our [WordPress migrator](https://ghost.org/help/importing-from-wordpress/).

### Supported Content

What is supported:

* XML files up to 100mb
* Up to 2,500 posts
* Some shortcodes, such as `[caption]`, `[audio]`, `[code]`, along with most `[vc_]` & `[et_]` based shortcodes from page builder plugins.

Whatâ€™s not supported:

* Custom post types
* Most uncommon shortcodes
* Plugins that alter access to content

## Complex Migrations

For more complex migrations, those comfortable with the command line can use our CLI tools.

First, install the CLI. Then build and run your command. All options for this tool can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TryGhost/migrate/tree/main/packages/mg-wp-xml).

```bash
# Install
npm install --global @tryghost/migrate

# Migrate posts only, add a 'News' tag, retain the existing /yyyy/mm/dd/slug permalink structure
migrate wp-xml --pathToFile ./file.xml --pages false --addTag News --datedPermalinks '/yyyy/mm/dd/'
```

## Troubleshooting

If youâ€™re having trouble exporting an XML file, or have lot of content, try the [API-based tools](https://github.com/TryGhost/migrate/tree/main/packages/mg-wp-api) which can successfully handle migrations with tens of thousands of posts.

Authors who were migrated will most likely need to reset their passwords, which can be done when logging into Ghost.

## Summary

Congratulations on your migration to Ghost ðŸ™Œ. All thatâ€™s left to do is check over your content to ensure the migration has worked as expected. We also have a guide on [how to implement redirects](https://ghost.org/tutorials/implementing-redirects/#common-redirects) to make your transition smoother.
