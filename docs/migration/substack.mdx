## **Run the migration**

The Substack migrator allows you to quickly import content and members from your Substack to your Ghost publication. You can access the migrator tool from the **Settings â†’ Advanced â†’** **Import/Export** area of Ghost Admin.

It's helpful to log in to your Substack account before running the migration in Ghost Admin.

### **1. Enter your Substack URL**

To start the migration process, enter the public URL to your Substack, and click **Continue**.

After a few moments, you'll see a confirmation message, confirming that your data was successfully migrated to your Ghost site.

### **Substack fees**

Ghost does not take a cut of your revenue. Substack will continue to take **10% fees** on your existing paid subscriptions. If you would like help getting payment fees removed, contact [concierge@ghost.org](mailto:concierge@ghost.org).

### **Statement descriptor**

The statement descriptor is what's shown on bank statements, and depending on how the account was set up, might include 'Substack' in the name. We recommend updating this in your [Stripe public details settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/update/public/support-details).
